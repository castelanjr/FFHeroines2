# FinalFantasyHeroines2

Android example app using MVP and tons of cool libraries. This project is actually the same one I wrote ~2 years ago (https://github.com/castelanjr/FinalFantasyHeroines), but usingall the stuff I learned in these past 2 years. I'm now using MVP, and this time I wrote a few basic tests (unit and UI with Espresso).

## Libraries I'm using:
* Dagger 2
* RxJava + RxAndroid + Retrolambda
* OkHttp3 + Retrofit2
* AutoValue + AutoValue-Moshi + AutoValue-Parcel
* Picasso, ButterKnife, Timber and LeakCanary

## TODO:
* Rewrite it all over again, but using Kotlin this time!
